# Overview

GripMock is a **mock server** for **gRPC** services. It's using a `.proto` file to generate implementation of gRPC service for you.
You can use gripmock for setting up end-to-end testing or as a dummy server in a software development phase.
The server implementation is in GoLang but the client can be any programming language that support gRPC.

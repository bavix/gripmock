# Why You Should Always Specify IDs in Stubs

Explicitly defining **UUID-based IDs** in your stub configurations unlocks powerful capabilities in GripMock, from precise stub management to seamless developer workflows. Here's why IDs are essential:

## 1. Universal Identification 🔍  
Every stub **MUST** have a UUIDv4 identifier:  
```yaml  
- id: 7f746310-a470-43dc-9eeb-355dff50d2a9 # ✅ Valid UUIDv4  
  service: BookingService
  method: GetBooking
  input:
    equals:
      bookingId: "booking_123"
  output:
    data:
      bookingTime:
        startTime: "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
        endTime: "2024-01-01T23:59:59Z"
```  

- ❌ Don't use custom strings like `my_stub_123`  
- ✅ Generate with `uuidgen` or [online tools](https://bavix.github.io/uuid-ui/)

## 2. Admin Panel Efficiency 🚀  
Instantly locate stubs in the web UI:  
```bash  
# Open in your browser
http://localhost:4771/#/stubs/7f746310-a470-43dc-9eeb-355dff50d2a9/show
```

::: warning
Search by ID in the admin panel is not available yet; use the direct URL for now.

## 3. Dead Stub Detection 🧹  
Clean up abandoned stubs via API:  
```bash  
# Find unused stubs  
curl http://localhost:4771/api/stubs/unused

# Delete if unused  
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:4771/api/stubs/7f746310-a470-43dc-9eeb-355dff50d2a9 
```  

## 4. Live Reloading Magic 🔄  

::: warning
Warning! If you do not specify IDs in your stubs, IDs may change when the file is updated.
:::

Enable automatic updates **without restarting GripMock**:  
```bash  
# .env configuration  
STUB_WATCHER_ENABLED=true # Default value: true
STUB_WATCHER_INTERVAL=5000ms # Default value: 1s.
STUB_WATCHER_TYPE=fsnotify # Filesystem events. Default value: fsnotify. Other options: timer.  
```  
1. Edit `stubs/feature_x.yaml` in your IDE  
2. GripMock auto-updates **only modified stubs**  
3. No API calls or restarts needed  

::: info
In timer mode, GripMock does not reload all stubs every N seconds. It reloads only files with updated modification times.
:::

## 5. Collision Prevention ⚠️  
Unique IDs prevent conflicts in multi-team environments:  
```yaml  
# Team A's stub  
- id: 6e8b4c2a-3d8f-4a1b-8c9d-0e7f2a9b8c7d  
  service: Payments  
  method: Process  

# Team B's stub  
- id: 9f1a2b3c-4d5e-6f7a-8b9c-0d1e2f3a4b5c  
  service: Payments  
  method: Refund  
```  

### Key Implementation Rules 📌  
- 🆔 **UUIDv4 required** (no custom formats)  
- 🔄 Auto-reloading requires both:  
  - `id` field in YAML/JSON  
  - `STUB_WATCHER_ENABLED=true`  
- 🚫 Never reuse IDs across environments

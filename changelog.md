## What's Changed

* [3.1] gRPC Descriptors by [@rez1dent3](https://github.com/rez1dent3) in https://github.com/bavix/gripmock/pull/572
  GripMock now supports Protocol Buffers descriptors for real-time generation, eliminating the need for code regeneration and Go-specific dependencies. This major update simplifies workflows, boosts performance, and removes Docker as a hard dependency.

### Key Improvements:

- **Descriptor-Driven Workflow**: Users can now provide pre-compiled descriptor files (`.pb`) instead of relying on Go-based schema compilation. This aligns with modern practices and removes language-specific barriers.
- **Standalone Binary**: GripMock is now a self-contained binary with zero external dependencies, making it easier to deploy and run anywhere.
- **Optimized Docker Image**: The Docker image size has been drastically reduced, as it no longer requires compilers, build tools, or intermediate artifacts.

This update addresses key pain points raised by the community, including [#268](https://github.com/bavix/gripmock/issues/268), [#442](https://github.com/bavix/gripmock/issues/442), and valuable feedback from [@holgerstolzenberg](https://github.com/holgerstolzenberg) and [@KenxinKun](https://github.com/KenxinKun).

Special thanks to:

- **[@holgerstolzenberg](https://github.com/holgerstolzenberg)** for their detailed feedback and suggestions, which helped shape this release and improve GripMock's usability for non-Go projects.
- **[@KenxinKun](https://github.com/KenxinKun)** for proposing the use of pre-compiled proto descriptor files ([#442](https://github.com/bavix/gripmock/issues/442)).
